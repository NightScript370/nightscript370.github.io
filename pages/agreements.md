## Scheduling

I currently attend a College which surrounds a Talmudic study schedule. This is my full schedule, on days that I'd be able to do programming.

- This will be altered by Jewish holidays, which lasts for two days from sundown to nightfall of the 2nd day
- Friday has an availability period until midday. This is unpredictable, though; since I don't have any courses, I am more likely to sleep in.
- Saturdays have an availability that starts at night-fall.

My college handles its secular courses through a Monday/Wednesday & Tuesday/Thursday system, each to their own degree of homework assignments. The time slots I will allocate to work will be during the "Free Time" periods, and may even have a part during meal-times.

This will need some cooporation from the client, though. Since each day has its own slots, I expect most of my communication will take place through text that I can read at any time. Please do not attempt to call me unless it's urgent and time-sensitive, or I have explicitly given an exception based on the type of work.

## Behavioral Guidelines

- Although any suggestion I may make is not a mandatory follow, I expect it to be well considered and have a response that can reflect a fault with what I suggest if there are any disagreements.
- There may be technical issues that can arise which are outside of my control. Although I will account for this when making a schedule, any post-rendering changes are not bound by the initial timeline.
- Payment is expected through both a paycheck and respect. While I am willing to negotiate prices, my qualifications and alternative obligations should be factors in which type of language you use when communicating.

## Connections to Public Media

- By not objecting pre-employment, you give me the implicit right to share anything (excluding private-communications logs) to other platforms. This is currently limited to WhatsApp (through "Stories"), the NightScript Domain Website (nightscri.pt), channels on Discord & GitHub.
- If any of my software pre-employment is used, I have the right to backport any changes to the original version.
