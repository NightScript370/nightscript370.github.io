title: Agreements
description: Code of Conduct & Ethics when working with me
---

This contract is a binding set of agreements for whoever chose to work with "NightScript". By employing me, you willfully acknowledge that you will abide by the guidelines described in this document. Consequences may include a consulting with the HR department or a full on resignation.

## Scheduling

- For our intents and purposes, there are ""three"" religious holidays that prevent me from coming online during the months of April-June during those days the holiday is celebrated. Each of them last for two full days + a work-prohibition on the eve starting at mid-day (11:30-at earliest). While the first two are 7 days apart, the last one is set 7 weeks apart. You will be alerted before these days.
- The same concept of Jewish holidays return during September-October, but all take place within the span of 24 days. In addition to the 3 sets of 2-days, there is a 4th holiday that lasts a full 25 hours. This will also be alerted
- Beyond these time-bound holidays, there is also the Sabbath, which prevents me to do any work on Saturday. Since its work-restrictions starts at mid-day, Early-Friday & Late-Night-Saturdays are spent on mental health maintenance. Availability can be set, albeit only if needed (due to its unpredictable nature, considering nightfall times change every months based on the seasons)

The other days of the year are when I am expected to work on College courses, each with their own degree of homework. Below is the full schedule, as per what our Talmud-study-oriented College set for us students:

My college handles its secular courses through a Monday/Wednesday & Tuesday/Thursday system, each to their own degree of homework assignments. The time slots I will allocate to work will be during the "Free Time" periods, and may even have a part during meal-times.

This will need some cooporation from the client, though. Since each day has its own slots, I expect most of my communication will take place through text that I can read at any time. Please do not attempt to call me unless it's urgent and time-sensitive, or I have explicitly given an exception based on the type of work.

## Behavioral Guidelines

- Although any suggestion I may make is not a mandatory follow, I expect it to be well considered and have a response that can reflect a fault with what I suggest if there are any disagreements.
- There may be technical issues that can arise which are outside of my control. Although I will account for this when making a schedule, any post-rendering changes are not bound by the initial timeline.
- Payment is expected through both a paycheck and respect. While I am willing to negotiate prices, my qualifications and alternative obligations should be factors in which type of language you use when communicating.

## Connections to Public Media

- By not objecting pre-employment, you give me the implicit right to share anything (excluding private-communications logs) to other platforms. This is currently limited to WhatsApp (through "Stories"), the NightScript Domain Website (nightscri.pt), channels on Discord & GitHub.
- If any of my software pre-employment is used, I have the right to backport any changes to the original version.
