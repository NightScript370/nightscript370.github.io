Happy Halloween everyone. I personally don't celebrate this event, but there is another event I celebrate during this month; my birthday. This year's October 22nd is the year I turned 17, and what a crazy timeline of events occurred during my life time. Moving from Canada into the United States has ~~been a mistake~~ led me to take a much more independent lifestyle, taking a lot of risks. School Switches, Discord Server Management, Gaining a new family and quite a deep depression period occurred, but most of these events have thankfully had a safe recovery.

Since I was exposed to the internet at a very young age, my partake in online events created a disconnect between my physical age and my mental age. Whereas most teenagers were going through their edgy phase throughout High School, I already had a history of these events through 8th grade. This does not imply that I am mature, but rather, just slightly more than my peers.

This article was originally supposed to come out on my birthday and have content that spanned my entire teenager years (outside March - August 2020, which I already wrote an article about). However, a split had to occur in order to keep this from being way too long, and the writing conflicted with the type of message I wanted to present on this blog. This led into a lot of rewrites, and as such, got delayed multiple times. I think it's finally ready to publish this though.<br>
Also, this is more-so aimed towards a younger generation of students just entering their teen years as opposed to my natural "everyone can read". Feel free to read this if you are interested in my life story, but most of these events can be summarized as "who cares".

### RAP wars & the fate of my math education

Spitting out straight fire and acting rebellious seems to be "cool" and "popular", even when it amounts to literally nothing. Add in a math teacher that officially endorsed it and the time spent in class would contain 25% of actual rapping and the other 75% being overly hyped for these (mediocre) battles. While it was limited to that one class (other teachers being too kind and the ultimate edge-lord teacher found rapping to be "low-level edge"), these songs struct the ears of the passerby students.

I was no stranger to rapping, having done 4 songs myself (one of which being on my middle school principle ðŸ˜‚). The class would not like to hear that I had moved on, so I was frequently summoned. Of course, being ***ultimate edgelord*** via plagiarizing Infinite from Sonic Forces quotes, I was viewed as a "worthy competitor" and a way to knock the teacher off the rapping throne he sat on. However, as I said above, I had a very different mindset from the rest of my class. I viewed it as "can we just move on" and "why do teachers go so far to connect with these students that would make him be treated like a joke"? But hey, I was respected across my peers; this is what got me popular in middle school so surely it'll get me popular in high school, right?

Turns out I was quite wrong. The people I actually looked up viewed me as immature and the people I was aiming to impress broke the single rule I imposed; I would not like to be recorded.

The reason I don't like being recorded is due to preservation. When you post things online, there is a permanent record of it. Downloading videos is quite the norm (I pirate JoJo music using NewPipe all the time, so I would know), so a record of me being cringy will always exist. I guess a problem with me when discussing online is that I'd like to maintain a serious record, so looking up my name wouldn't show any dumb things I used to do. I place little faith in anyone to properly handle my online identity (I even suspected this event would occur but looked past it for "funs sake"), and this event here is proof: the video of the RAP battle has been published, with my real life first name and last name. My response was not pretty.

With this teacher, I had done two RAP battles. The first one was published online without my knowledge while I caught the second rap battle during its recording process. It was only a week after my second battle and three weeks after my first battle where I was informed, which left me in tears the day I was made aware. After an argument occured, my bags were packed and I switched into the 9th grade honors math class rather than the regular. It taught a completely different subject and I needed to have the class I was currently in to go to this new class, but I thought it was simply a record. Unfortunately, it was also the knowledge of that class which was required, and not simply the record.

The way I learn is by jumping straight into experimentation rather than looking at the docs. It has led to many issues (which Evie always ends up fixing), but it allows me to grasp a concept better than being taught normally. It's how I learned that in C++, switch cases are limited to integers as opposed to other languages which can have any value there. I figured I can do that here as well, but jumping into Geometry without knowing Algebra led me into getting a lot of issues.

I was frequently behind, often times requiring individual lessons on Algebra concepts from the Geometry teacher. Even then, my buddy trainboy2019 ended up helping me with my homework and taught concepts I was too afraid to ask. I ended up barely scraping a good grade in the class, which is a far contrast to what happened the following year.<br>
My original plan of taking Algebra 1 during the summer failed due to software failures (and this is why you don't put all your eggs in one basket). The only other way I was able to do Algebra 1 was to join the 9th grade class, which thankfully were not as privacy invasive as my class. Unfortunately, they do view me as the weakling and the one that always gets mad, and as such, I was a primary target. This also followed into Gym class, since there is a time conflict between the 10th grade gym period and the 9th grade algebra 1 period. This ended up being in my benefit though, as the teacher took pity and let me off the hook countless times. I managed to finish Gym with 103%, higher than my actual 9th grade gym grade. I also ended up being smarter than everyone else in the 9th Grade Algebra 1 class, due to trainboy's help the year before. Unfortunately, this luck would not transfer over when I switched schools.

Since I now fulfilled the requirements that I needed, my new school allowed me to have a normal 11th grade schedule (for the most part, but we'll get into that later). This meant that I was in Algebra II with other 11th graders, who thankfully were deserving of their honors titles. The first half of the class was just a review of Algebra 1, so coming straight off the boat from there and not taking a gap year, I should have done good, right?<br>
Turns out that too much pity is a bad thing when it comes to actual education, as I barely scraped the class with a passing grade when I was done 1st semester. For the 2nd semester, they decided that I should go to a different class because I took Algebra 1 the year before. In other words, ***they intend for students to have a gap year just to force a semester of pure review cause Algebra II cannot span an entire year, yet that raises the question of why I was left in the first half when I should have gone straight to the second half***. This other class ended up being a "Intro to Data Science" class, which had quite a negative teacher. He "taught" us the R programming language, which ended up being a really cool language, but too bad I could not use it elsewhere. That didn't matter though, as I was quite unmotivated to do anything while the teacher was acting so negative all the time. During Valentine's day, I had enough of it and wrote a 2 page essay on how negative he is. This led to other kids letting out their anger as well, which was fine and all until I was called to the principals office 2 weeks after. The teacher physically pushed a student out of class, which got him into a quarantine. As part of the investigation the school did, someone mentioned my rant, how I hated the teacher. He ended up coming back but hey, that didn't matter as the school shut down the week after he returned. To summarize how he taught during the pandemic, read my other article.

So, what started off as a simple harmless RAP battle ended up destroying my math. I often ask Evie to help me out with certain concepts (like how to remove percentages from a number), which feels embarrassing when I used to consider math to be my specialty back in elementary. To reflect on this, I should have never aimed for popularity in the first place. I also should have stood my ground initially, not give into their desires to make me immature again. I suppose for the younger folk reading this, please do start worrying about your future from this early age.

### Anti-iPhone gone legal

The RAP battles brought my status to the school as a much more popular student, as the story was told over that a challenger has topped the king of rapping. This was combined with the fact that people know how technologically advanced I am as I started a programming club + my popular sister went to the school (which I have reasons to suspect most of the followers are bots omegalul). The responsibility had to be handled quite well, since people looked up to me as an example of "cool kid yet not a jerk". However, combine that with the behavior typically held by 17 year olds (which is to get vengeance every time someone does even the slightest mistake) and a manipulative online friend in a school where online interactions with strangers are considered dangerous by the staff (even though everyone has a social media account) and you get the title of responsibility lost. Although I proved my point about iProducts being iCrap, it made my reputation turn into iCrap too ðŸ˜›

A former online friend of mine was going through rough times, which lead them to tweeting "I will kill myself in 24 hours". After no update was given in the 24 hour time span they gave themselves, my real-life self was found crying in the school halls due to the thought that this person ended up dead. This caught the attention of the school administration, which sent me home for the day. My class' WhatsApp group chat was filled with messages saying that I'm only doing this for attention, which had officially crossed the line.

Permanent revenge was not my plan (I didn't want to get thrown out of the school or get people in higher rankings involved) but they needed to be learnt a lesson on how to treat someone with an experience like this. Tech Twitter came to the rescue, documenting a new iOS 11 bug that would kill whatever process the bug found itself on. Website tabs would no longer become accessible, chat tabs could no longer have communications, but what if it were on a system process, like Notifications? What if you blow that up to 26 notifications, going around to every kid in your class that's on a WhatsApp group chat? That's what I did after some heavy experimentations with it first, to make sure that it wasn't permanent. What I didn't know at the time was how crappy was the iCrap software.

The mess that followed was surprising. First off, some kids with iPhones texted "huh?" implying that their phone didn't break. Some kids were like "that's cool" implying that the phone crashed but recovered on its own and got "immune". At that point, I thought "huh, didn't work" and went to sleep not thinking of what I've done. What I should have figured was that a) not everyone who was on the groupchat and had an apple device should have gotten their phone broken and b) not everyone knows the trick to recover. The Apple Store was contacted, the night was spent trying to recover, but some just gave up. The next morning was spent trying to fix everyone's phone, and almost all were fixed. Keyword: almost.

A student had a completely different outcome from his classmates, one which I was not expecting to happen. Loss of Cellular Service and frequent crashes quickly turned into a permanent boot-loop. Not wanting to waste the $950 he spent on the phone, entire class periods were wasted on our argument, going as far as to bring in an attorney. He was in the right to try and make me pay originally (and hey, I ended up giving 50$) but the weird thing is that 2 months following, he dropped the charges. To this day, I still wonder how I was able to walk my way out of that situation I was 100% in the wrong in. Okay, maybe I debated some things he said, but at the end of the day, I was the instigator. This kid is my good friend, and he even bought me cupcakes on my birthday. Though, my fears have never been solved since then.

I have lost my ability to be comfortable with people I know in real life over text. I've also started to separate more of my online life and my human life, making me even more fearful to be on group chats. Android has a "frequently contact" section on their share page, which I can't seem to disable for some reason. I'm always scared that I would end up showing my online self to people who could view it wrongly, and I'm also fearful that I could accidentally leak my address and such.<br>
Please keep events where it's relevant, and don't try to get revenge. Consequences will occur and they might not be so kind. ~~Although, if people you are trying to get revenge are all Nintendo 3DS users, keep them on the non-latest firmware~~

### Mario Making Mods Hack of April Fools
So what happened with the bastard that faked their suicide and got me into this huge mess that almost lost me around 1K? The quote of "You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain" applied quite a bit to her, as she tried to re-friend me as if nothing happened. A true friend, though, would never act the way they did:

- Friends would never put others in a situation where they're bashed for simply being next to them.
- Friends would never try to run away (not just this event; I've counted each time they made a new discord account and each time they changed their personality, and the answer turned out to be at least 89 times that I'm aware of) and abandon everyone.

Most importantly though, friends would never take advantage of someone for their entertainment, to mock their history. My foot was set down this time, and I decided not to accept the latest friend request they sent me. My suspicions about him not growing up and just taking advantage were confirmed, as his response was "oh, we can stop fake being his friend, now we can make fun of him openly"

Back in 2015, a website of mine titled "Super All Stars Gaming" was hacked and turned into the now infamous "Maor Circus". It featured circus music, epileptic colors and a whole load of mean comments. Him and his friend were obsessed with it, mentioning it about once a week every day behind my back (despite me clearly getting frustrated when they brought it up to my face). They even called me by my IRL name when I had already switched to another name (that being NightYoshi370). I blocked both of them and took them both out of my life. It was, after all, my decision and it didn't affect anyone else personally.

But who cares about not punishing everyone for one man's mistakes when you can out them out as a clown, right?<br>
That's what they ended up thinking, as the day I end up going offline, Maor Circus was revived from its cursed grave. The additional bonus was that it was on a website people actually knew about and wasn't just my own personal segregated community, so the exposure was much grander. This led to a lot of questions and a lot of harassment when I realized my DB backup was old. I was irresponsible, and thought I already made a backup, yet the one I actually found was a month old. I almost gave up on getting the site back, but thankfully one of the attackers thought of taking a backup beforehand. After needlessly arguing, I finally got my own data back and Mario Making Mods was back online. Funny thing was, I predicted that I would come back online to find my site hacked, the exact day I was gone. The Discord Server didn't suffer any losses, and tried to host their own event titled "Wario's Washing Woods". Obviously questions were asked on there but people were mainly on discord.

I suppose in Mario Making Mods' current direction of having a Discord-only community, this event could be largely overlooked. However, this taught me a couple of lessons:

<ol>
	<li><b>If you see an unhealthy relationship, break it down as early as possible.</b><br>
		Continuing to be friend with those who take advantage of you leads you to getting taken advantage of even more. If someone's a bad friend at the start, it's rare they'll change by the end.</li>
	<li><b>Separate person from group</b><br>
		You don't like someone? Good. That doesn't have everyone has to pay. Acknoledge that some people might not agree with all of that single person's actions. For example, just because a classmate is a Biden supporter doesn't mean everyone in the class hates Trump. Everyone has the right to their own personal opinion. </li>
	<li><b>NEVER publicly humiliate someone</b><br>
		Public humiliation (especially when they've only done something to you and not to the public) is a quick way to ruin someone in front of people they might have had a close relationship with. Plus, what about the people that do not care what they've done and instead just came somewhere for that one purpose?</li>
</ol>

The way the attacker got access to the DB was my own fault. I let the attackers friend host something on my server and I never bothered to change the password even when I switched the server. The friend deeply regrets giving over the credentials, but took steps towards improving themself and now is a much better person. They cut off contact with the attacker and after a few months of being lost, the manipulation the attacker put on them became apparent. Unfortunately, the attacker is still out there trying to act over dramatic, talking about how they should kill themselves in the third person and mentioning every friend they had in a reply to a call out post. I am still mentioned by my real name, and the past is brought up way too much, but that's ok; what they do about us is no longer our concern. We do, however, worry that this person would start acting pedophilic to others and to drag down the maturity level of growing children, ones that are unable to identify they have been manipulated. I created a call-out post on Twitter and they admitted to it, though, so that means that I can now just point to that any time they try to run away.

Since this incident, the attackers friend and I have been accepted back into communities we've been kicked out of (because of the attacker's bad behavior), developing amazing projects and getting attention for something other than pity. Our lives hold large responsibilities, and we can't be held back by our past.

### English Teachers in my old school
I never get to have a break with English teachers, huh? It's like it's cursed to *specifically* have the worst teachers be the teachers of my class.<br>
Right before our school gave us a 2 week break, my English 10A teacher resigned from his job. [Looking back at one of the assignments he gave us](/assets/English9A.odt), I realized that most of the way I think had originated from him. He taught us that writing analysis was the philisophical viewpoints you could interpret rather than the level of interest you had when reading essays. This led me to believe that English classes were about becoming independent thinkers and deep discussions, involving debates and putting yourself in other peoples shoes. If he were still here, I'm sure he would have been proud of the "[What is considered Ownership](/blog/ownership-issues)" and "[Online School Issues](/blog/online-school-issues)" articles. Unfortunately, we had a teacher who valued English class as a time to play with *toy cars*.

The class's tests was moreso about retaining the text in memory and not about anything we can learn from it. The students noticed my teacher's ignorance as bliss and expressed their wild behavior, which resulted in the bullies rulling the classroom. The assignments handed out were things we already did but with the additional benefit of ***everyone*** in the school having the exact same assignment. It resulted in an uneven balance, where 12th graders would receive work that insulted their inteligence level and 9th graders thought they were getting an ancient history paper from Emerson. I viewed this as a serious downgrade and decided to do my own improvement to my English skills, while hopefully bringing everyone out of the mess that is this class.

A seekage for justice was needed, but no one took the time to document the issues and instead just individually brought it up. After interviewing many students and a missed Geometry class (the teacher realized I was doing something important and let me do my own thing), a 10 page essay was written detailing every flaw with him that I noticed during the month of April-May. While not as impressive as my 7 page essay about Edgenuity (which I wrote later and was within a week of using the service), I let out a lot of hatred using it. When the school's social worker caught wind, she was impressed and decided to bond with me, leading to a brand new relationship. For a while, I was the only student that had her personal phone number (and it would have remained that way if it weren't for students needed to contact her during the pandemic).

I would like to believe that the school looked at it, but my writing there was awful and way out of line so I suspect they hadn't. For one, I openly disrespected a staff member to the principal, which I'm surprised didn't land me several referals. I also wrote for too long, losing most people's attention span quite quickly. In fact, looking at my faults with that paper led me to realizing how long my articles have become and started to tone them way down. In the long run, this benefited me much more than my cause. Then again, my cause was fulfilled as the teacher ended up not returning for the school year of 2019-2020, when I would be in 11th grade. This meant I had to deal with him for 10th grade, but I was saved midway by my social worker.

After a mishandling of the Frakenstein reading assignments, a new English 10B class was made for students that were either fed up with the old teacher or just had really poor English. I and a friend of mine were the only two that fit into the former category out of a class of 7 students, which led to us overtaking discussions meant for the entire class. Being overqualified also had other disadvantages, being graded way too fairly for what was pretty bad writting just because we were better than everyone else. Still, better to be overqualified and have good grades than being overqualified and have bad grades due to mishandling not on your part. A nitpick I had with this new teacher was that since I talked to her often before, she knew ways of getting me to do work and knew of the skill I had. It was also quite hard to transition from stating her first name to the "Mrs." pronoun + last name.

A lesson that can be learned from here is that you should know what you're getting into when you take a class. Consider its courses and determine if you really need it, and if you need to take it there. There are plenty of alternative options you could do, and if there aren't, the power of speech can make one. However, when you fight for your cause, do it in a way that is concise and respectful. Focus on knocking down their points and building up yours rather than attach feelings to it.

-----

Ending off my 9th grade as a seekage for a teacher reform, my life was turning quite liberal. My opinion started to become my own rather than a mere representation of what I was fed. The older folk acknowledged me as someone that could have quite interesting debates, something I find myself doing quite often lately due to the Election next week. I might not have handled every situation well, but many of the decisions I have done have stuck with me.

- My limitations in math have allowed me to switch from a fixed mindset to a creative mindset, helping me with writing
- My online life has become rather separate from my real life. My life has become quite secretive in general, like Diavolo's. No one needs to know what I do at home, unless I have good reason to trust them.
- My sites are now static as opposed to dynamic. I cannot trust someone else not to input shady stuff.
- I still rebel against things I don't find right, even if people in my social surroundings don't agree or simply don't care

This has been a year that put me on my track, a track that I would follow in my 10th grade
