# Progressive Development
{:.mb-0}
<small class="font-italic font-weight-light font-underline">Published on November 22nd, 2020</small>

My first job writing articles (and not dumb rants) was as a part of my school newspaper, writing articles on what goes on in our universe from a high school students point of view (don't try to find it; I don't identity as NightScript when doing anything locally and there are hundreds of people that share my real life name). Of course, I now believe it's a propaganda machine and making a name for yourself would be much better done if you did it on a personal blog, but I am proud of these students for trying to represent the school. Though, that ain't helpful when your representation is of poor quality, such as an article I wrote and want taken down. In a recent meeting, I expressed the idea of potentially deleting articles that were irrelevant and old, since I didn't want to admit that I wasn't proud of my work. My collegues, however, want to show the growth that they've made for their college application, which makes me wonder why people would like to show others a lack of quality as "progress".

Looking back at older work is nostalgic for most, but I view it as a sign of embarassment. Standards evolve, styles improve, and I don't want to put my best quality work right next to one that looks like it came out of a teenage girl's diary. The issue isn't limited to writing but rather, as a representation of anything that would be presented to a general public (so everything but code). Books would not be interesting if there was no climax and instead was just like modern TV shows, having no overall plot. Songs are one thing that need to flow, since shoving a billion words when you only have 2 seconds to say them would result in no one being able to listen to what you're actually saying without looking at the lyrics (yet I am starting to doubt the legistics of that, seeing as how that's basically the fate of modern rock and rap songs).

Yesterday, I ran into a real-life friend of mine (of course following COVID-19 precautions) who I've recently introduced to the site. Since he isn't into video games, past experiences or technology, I used the first article I've ever written to appease him; "What is Considered Ownership". I like that article, but it was made 6 months prior and my skills have evolved. He noted that the language quality used is quite unlike the one I express myself in currently, which showed I have evolved in my writing skills. I was told "well, you gotta constantly develop your skills", which lead me to start thinking; How does our style change and how are skills developed? Experience? Inspiration? What makes us into how we are today?

### Experience --- History that doesn't determine anything

Over the past 2 months, blog articles on this site have either seen a massive rewrite or a structural change. Wording was improved, images were added, sentences flowed better and the detail was enhanced. However, notice that out of 18 articles I've ever writen, only 7 (this being my 7th article) have actually been published? The rest is either on the web-server but just not linked to or are too underdeveloped so they were moved to discord channels. If we were to give a hypothetical rate, I write 3 articles every month, but only one end up published. It kind of wears me down and demotivates me, hence why I've writen in a more personalized manner with my later articles.

My first ever article was the "What is Considered Ownership" article, but between that and July, I was going to follow up that level of quality talking about the school system and how it can be revamped. However, that article drifted off path and ended up just being a rant about College Board and how awful they were. I ended up taking aspects of it and placing them into other articles, but the main topic about learning styles never got adapted. I then tried to take the gaming section on my home page (back when it was text heavy instead of the grid layout) and perhaps make that an entry, but that also drifted off the path from "hey, I like complex games" to a Project Plus advertisement and "Mario is a boring platformer". Yeah, not what I had in mind. I had to reuse a thread I previously wrote on Mario Making Mods about a potential Sonic Mania sequel, which turned into "Classic Sonic: Infinite's return". This article is nothing like the original one I had on Mario Making Mods, yet it's not a downproof to my belief that experience =/= progressive development. That's just because of the medium that blogs are compared to threads on a forum software.

It's not some foreign issue from the past either, as it's rather a common occurence that also just happened this month. The original article planned to come out was supposed to focus on the current election going on in the United States as a way to give my opinion on current events. However, it smeered from "Hey, I have high respects for some republicans but I think Trump went too far" into "WEAR MASKS ULTRA-FAR-RIGHT-WINGED REPUBLICANS", which is out of line when I start attacking people. This article was made to replace that one, hence why it's much shorter in comparison to my other ones. What I would like to derive your attention towards is the dates of these failed articles. The failed political article was written this month, **after** I rewrote 4 other articles. As you can see, if quality improvement was based on time passing alone, I am either extremely forgetful or I should just quit. But these faults don't happen just to me, because I've seen other people make masterpieces only to revert back to their old quality.

### Inspiration --- Lazy & Perhaps Delusional

Watching how Hiroiko Araki (the creator of JoJo's Bizzare Adventure) develops characters like Giorno Giovanna has been a major source of personal inspiration, as opposed to my former identity which is similar to Fugo. However, I am not Giorno; I am NightScript. I can see who I want to be through other people, but I chose to be like them; it's not because "oh, funny hair dude make cool poses". I take certain aspects that I see of him but I don't want to be Giorno IRL.

Inspiration is helpful for getting new ideas, but the thing is that if you're getting your idea from elsewhere, then clearly that idea already exists. The whole point about making a unique experience is to see **your** style, not whoever you plagirized from. Sonic's idea about having speed being a reward rather than via a simple button press is what gives it its appeal. The Mario & Luigi series took the RPG formula and added timings + a quirky story. It all depends on presentation and uniqueness. Progression by copying is not progress but rather plagirism.

It's why I hate those that try to be the next big thing; If your aim is popularity, than you would sacrifice quality and uniqueness. I love Scott the Woz and his style of jokes inspire me, yet taking his jokes and just placing it onto my articles won't make me into him. I could have very well added in "Progressive Development is the process of changes through which a developer's body matures into a paid developer capable of sexual reproductio~this is the Wikipedia article for [Puberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty)", yet that joke has already been made in his [2D to 3D](https://youtu.be/tX5SPXE_ZV4?t=89) video. It wouldn't be funny saying the same joke someone else already made. To repeat the sentence I wrote above, progression by copying is not progress but rather plagirism.

### Feedback --- Other viewpoints

But if you'd like to know what **isn't** plagirism and what the ultimate leadup for progressive development, look no further than feedback. You get direct answers from those you get inspiration by and because of the experience factor, you won't make those mistakes again. I now realize why my friend is always looking for feedback, and while I don't think he's right in the sense to punish those who don't give feedback, getting a reply makes you feel like someone actually wants you to improve and took the time to read what you had to say. Come to think about it, I now understand why receiving "k" is offensive, since you don't even put in any input but instead did the bear minimum that you couldn't have even write the full "ok" sentence. Of course, unlike the people back in 2017, I won't ban others for simply writing out "k" but I now see how it offends others.

As frightening as it may seem for some (myself included), opinions are developed anytime anything gets shown to anyone. Personally, I put too much focus when someone calls me annoying, as it discourages me to continue on. When publishing articles or asking for polls, I always wonder what I can do to improve. Sometimes, I even openly state that I would love to be corrected. I could be stuborn and debate my ideas, but I try to keep an open mind and hear the other person out (except when it comes to bigotry or rudeness, I have no tolerance for those). I always appreciate when people either take the time to read what I have to say (hence why I'm shortening this blog post; just for y'all) or test my products and show me how they use it. Either way, it's important to be considerate.

Feedback doesn't need to someone else, and some times, you don't even need to put yourself in someone elses shoes. For example, I've recently writen a parody of Traitor's Requiem when my rebellious spirit was rising up and I needed to sing something in a language I could connect with (no, learning Japanese was not an option). The song had no focus point, as it was mostly me venting out my frustration against the world. Later on, I learned what my issues were and made a new parody called "Stranded Hope", this time using Fighting Gold as a base. The new song speaks about someone who lost everything, tries to find out someone like him throughout the Stardusts in the Sky, tries to find the light and then gets rid of their depression.

<p>The future can look very bright<br>
But tonight's the night where you will decide if it's right</p>

<p>Life might be a pain, that's part of fate<br>
Being brought down here, for a purpose that remains unknown, wandering on and on</p>

<p>Family Friends and others, I simply know them<br>
But who can I trust? Is there someone out there like me that has the same goals and dreams</p>

<p>Staying, on this planet, long after all hope is gone<br>
My pain persists</p>

<p>Fight with me, we will win this war<br>
Let's aim towards our destiny<br>
Don't care if it is quite a hard process<br>
As long as those we trust can still be safe<br>
This is what we will encapsulate<br>
And now, time to make the best out of ourselves</p>

<p>Managing my time spent, planning out<br>
Don't think this would get much support from our social surroundings but it is what we must do</p>

<p>Keeping ourselves safe from foreigners<br>
Tightening up our passwords<br>
Dodging the leakers left and right, moving up and about</p>

<p>Keeping these thoughts to myself<br>
Not revealing anything<br>
Quite a secretive plan</p>

<p>Even when things seem really bad<br>
And it looks like it's outside your hands<br>
Still fight on; reach out for that golden wind<br>
Don't give up; you have a bright future<br>
That's waiting for you to follow in its path<br>
Just fight on; you will reach that destination</p>

<p>Fight with me we will win this war<br>
Let's overtake our enemies<br>
Don't care how; As long as we get it done<br>
This will keep those who we know safe and sound<br>
And it's what I hope to be bound<br>
To our goals, which we need to go and fulfil them</p>

<p>Rejected by everyone<br>
Those who used to hear you out are done<br>
Getting your voice heard by no one</p>

<p>Expressing myself to a block<br>
My mouth might get a lock<br>
But my ideals stick to me as a rock</p>

<p>The wreckage that is my day<br>
Told things would be ok<br>
But my instincts are to run away</p>

<p>Trying, to find my hope<br>
Getting constantly told nope<br>
Can I ever find someone with whom I could cope?</p>

<p>Stranded hope<br>
Held back by my owns hands<br>
Searching for someone like myself<br>
Scattered through the stardusts in the sky<br>
My soul shines<br>
Without any reply<br>
The depression has taken me<br>
It needs to be overcomed<br>
Or else I could never find myself in me<br>
Stranded hope</p>

<p>Not trying to put up a fight<br>
Just wanting to find a light<br>
One that would set my destiny right</p>

<p>Cannot find anything like that here<br>
Even when I try far and near<br>
There's just no one that I hold so deer</p>

<p>Just need to wait my own turn<br>
To let my history burn<br>
Probably wouldn't give it a single mourn</p>

<p>Thinking the war is done<br>
It has only begun<br>
The things that go on are simply no fun</p>

<p>Stranded hope<br>
With a strong desire to move on<br>
Courage circulating around me<br>
But no way to accept it at all<br>
The chains of fate<br>
They are stuck to your gate<br>
Wanting to make a break out<br>
That's what this is all about<br>
But can that golden wind be found without any harm<br>
Stranded hope</p>

<p>The only hope I have<br>
is to follow myself and be free</p>

<p>Stranded hope<br>
Held back by my owns hands<br>
Searching for someone like myself<br>
Scattered through the stardusts in the sky<br>
My soul shines throughout the thousand replies<br>
The depression has lost control of me<br>
It has been overcomed<br>
Or else I could never have found myself in me<br>
Stranded hope</p>

### Potential Triangle of all three?

So, the true answer is feedback, but that doesn't mean inspiration and evolution isn't a major factor when trying to develop skills.

- When you get feedback, past experiences and failures are important so you don't repeat the same mistake.
- Inspiration is only wrong when it's plagirism or when done for the wrong purposes (such as trying to become the next big thing). Using it and putting your twist on things 

However, a triangle of all three is what's needed.
