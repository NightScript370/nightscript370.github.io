My first moments of independence was when I was 10 years old, back in 2014. Without my parents' permission, I was scrolling through YouTube when I found a video showcasing how to make custom New Super Mario Bros Wii levels~sorry, I mean [*courses*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/708423907731832882/799507169291665418/unknown.png). The video described things such as loading the Homebrew Channel and Riivolutions, two channels I did not own. Despite that, I still wanted to be involved because of how interesting it was to be getting more out of what I considered at the time to be the best video game ever. The description linked to the NSMBW Level Depot, which was just one section of the RVLution website. The main part was the forums, which I signed up on (and then later had to remake when they switched from phpBB to BlargBoard).

My goal was to make a full hack, which had a time travel mechanic. The rules on the site said I couldn't make a thread for things I didn't have progress on, so I setup my own blargboard forums. Rather than focus on the hack itself, though, I was busy being a bad moderator and shitposting. This was fine when it was just my brother and I playing around, but this was online, which means it was public for the world to see. Also, my brother was a year and a half younger than me, meaning he was 8. Either way, both of us were underage and lacked a level of maturity needed to be online.

The community rejected me, as I got banned on every website in the area. Even my co-owner and the one who helped make I was inexperienced, and often times made a fool out of myself. RVLution members knew me as moron322, and I was banned everywhere I went. This did not make me change, seeing as how I fit right in with other rejects. We tried so hard to get ourselves accepted in communities, yet we ended up making the same mistakes that got us banned originally. We were pushed away to our own corner of the internet, where we just made what they called derpboards using their own software. Even then, our sites would always get vandalized by these animals and 

7 years later, I still find myself joining new networks and groups, often times hoping to contribute. My contributions to the DS(i) Mode Hacking Discord Server reserved me a spot in Nintendo Modding History, alongside famous modders like RocketRobz & Evie. Through my time moderating that server, I've met amazing friends who have stuck with me ever since, such as Lanya, Kodtiz3D, Kaisaan, Evie and MUCH more. Wanting to stick this group alongside my other friends, I made a personal hub called the NightScript Domain. The response to articles like these keep me motivated to write more, and to contribute more. The community is always growing, so much so that last week, I added in a Matrix bridge for the Discord server (which I find myself using more than Discord). My social life is, as a result, primarily found online.

I love to contribute to the social surroundings I find myself in, seeing as how that's what true love is really about. Love isn't about what you love benefitting you, but how you can benefit it. Yamamura was something I loved, but what I really loved was all the time I found myself coding and managing to solve bugs with Samplasion. Rewritting articles on this website proves to be a tedious task (every single article on this website got an update since initial publish date), yet I constantly want to make sure they are of their utmost quality. It's why I've developed a workoholic behavior, but it doesn't bother me. Unfortunately, most of the teenagers in my social surroundings look at it different.

My parents are currently the most dismissive people of my creative potential, which is bad when I want my privacy. A """helicopter""" hovers over my physical actions at all times, watching my every move (such as where I am, why I'm leaving, etc). I often discouraged from doing what I do, even when it has proven to be successful. When I started tutoring children, I was told "well, do you know your stuff? Maybe you should let a proffessional do it". Once the kid ended up completing his project better than how a proffessional would have taught them, my parents would tell others about how *their* "marvelous-son" did these actions. Other times, they take credit for decisions I make, such as clothes I buy. What's worst is when I find myself being refused things I like "just because".

When I went to New York for my sister's wedding, I had breakfast by my brother-in-law's house alongside everyone else in my family. This is one of those "family bonding" times I was not able to leave, which was frustrating because I had already finished eating and there was no one to speak with there. I had Google Maps to tell me where to go, the journey was not long and it was in broad day light, so the risk of danger was low. There was no reason to keep me there beyond control, which is not something I like to be detained by. My intentions on leaving were to go to our temopary resitance house in order to study with friends and [contribute to TWiLight Menu++](/blog/summer-2020#part-8--nightscript-vs-twilight-menu). Though, they didn't know that, because I often times don't inform them of explanations.

I never tell my parents anything in terms of things that occurred, which means they get informed through other methods. When confronted with these events, my response is to act like a CIA officer, only telling them glimpses that they need to know and nothing more. They found out that I cried when [I thought my friend committed suicide](/blog/effects-of-9th-grade#anti-iphone-gone-legal), yet were never aware of who the person was or the after-math involving the iOS bug being sent out to my classmates. My refusal to do my work during the summer was something my teacher thought they needed to know, yet they never knew how I ended up [writting a rant about it](/blog/edgenuity-issues) (which got me [a good grade in the class](/blog/summer-2020#part-5--nightscript-vs-summer-school)). (Before you ask; I didn't expose myself through this article, as they don't even know I'm writting this or have my own website ðŸ˜›).

Unfortunately, I am dependent on people like my parents in order to provide me basic substinance. If I ever decide to escape one day, I would be at the mercy of not being able to afford life necessities (such as food or hotel room) due to not having a job. I am unable to get a job both due to age and this pandemic closing down a lot of businesses. Homelessness is not a bright option due to being unaware of what goes on during the streets at night time. This type of control that parents have over children is common (in fact, one of my bosses told me I'm *too* independent and that they would not let their hypothetical teenager do what I've done, despite it being proven to be successfull). However, it's not like breaking away hasn't been tried before.

Christopher McCandless was only a college graduate when he abandoned his old life and attempted to rebuild it. Learning of his father's relationship issues was a devistating blow, when a few years prior, he had gifted him a telescope for his birthday. After giving his parents a cold shoulder for a while, he decided to hide behind a mask to make them think that they've won. After that, he donated all his money to a charity and drove his car far away from home, dropping everyone he knew and loved in one fell-swoop. In his new life (under a new alias), Alex has jumped from household 

I am at their mercy for things such as getting a drivers license, fixing up my Canada -> US process and so much more. Homelessness is not a bright option to take, due to being unaware of what goes on during the streets. If I wanted to fend for myself, I'd have to rent out a hotel

Unfortunately, society hasn't accepted that 17 year olds

Most of the people in my social surroundings have their friends in person, which makes me feel This is in stark contrast to other classmates of mine in my social surroundings, as clearly observed when I independently decide to go to study on my own. While other 17 year olds waste their money going out with their thousandth girl-friend while watching brain-rottening video on TikTok, I find myself anti-social, preffering work habits that might make others look at me like I'm a workaholic. For my privacy article, I have worked for 4 hours straight and 9 hours in total on publish-day (December 31st, 2020), talking with antoine and discovering new things to add to my article. It wasn't until I got up after the straight work session where I discovered my hunger and my lack of food (which wasn't helpful when I was tutoring). I have also pushed sleep last week (January 7th, 2021) to work on an upcoming article regarding politics, staying up working until 11:30 PM/23:30 and falling asleep after 12:18 AM (but not without mocking Evie and StackZ, the two official non-sleepers of Universal-Team). I don't like to take time off, because I like to practice who I am.

Unfortunately, my parents aren't really too encouraging of who I am, often times trying to control me rather than let my life be. I have to tell them everywhere I go, otherwise I am not allowed to exit the house. I often get discouraged from doing what I do, even when it has proven to be successful. When I started tutoring children, I was told "well, do you know your stuff? Maybe you should let a proffessional do it". Once the kid ended up completing his project better than how a proffessional would have taught them, they end up bragging about it. Other times, they take credit for decisions I make, such as clothes I buy. This is why I try to stay relatively hidden from family.

The problem with this is that as of the initial publish date of this article, I am still under my parent' house and as such, I must respect their wishes. However, I try my best to have as much control of my life as possible, such as not tell them a 17 year old is considered underage and needs to be dependent on a guardian. The guardian typically doesn't understand what the kid wants, and dismisses their creative potential. When I went to New York for my sister's wedding, I was not allowed to walk home to go study and was forced to stay at my brother-in-law's house with everyone else. I felt frustrated because I needed to go home in order to study and [contribute to TWiLight Menu++](/blog/summer-2020#part-8--nightscript-vs-twilight-menu). This seems to be common, as one of my bosses told me how they would treat their hypothetical 17 year old son.

Although I've gathered quite an audience of live friends, this had been relatively hidden from my family. In fact, they are only aware of glimpses of personal events is because someone else disclosed few details to them. They found out that I cried when [I thought my friend committed suicide](/blog/effects-of-9th-grade#anti-iphone-gone-legal), yet were never aware of who the person was or the after-math involving the iOS bug being sent out to my classmates. My refusal to do my work during the summer was something my teacher thought they needed to know, yet they never knew how I ended up [writting a rant about it](/blog/edgenuity-issues) (which got me [a good grade in the class](/blog/summer-2020#part-5--nightscript-vs-summer-school)). When they demand explanations for what they do hear, I act like CIA officers who only tell them what they need to know and nothing more. (Before you ask; I didn't expose myself through this article, as they don't even know I'm writting this or have my own website ðŸ˜›).

The reason why I am like this is because I value things differently, hence why we always find ourselves in a conflict of interest due to a lack of mutual understanding. I value my work and studies, to the point of obsession and workaholic-ism. For my privacy article, I have worked for 4 hours straight and 9 hours in total on publish-day (December 31st, 2020), talking with antoine and discovering new things to add to my article. It wasn't until I got up after the straight work session where I discovered my hunger and my lack of food (which wasn't helpful when I was tutoring). I have also pushed sleep last week (January 7th, 2021) to work on an upcoming article regarding politics, staying up working until 11:30 PM/23:30 and falling asleep after 12:18 AM (but not without mocking Evie and StackZ, the two official non-sleepers of Universal-Team). I don't like to take time off, because I like to practice who I am.

However, I do not consider myself like the other 17 year olds my age. While they're out TikTok'ing and hanging out with their thousandth girl friend, I find myself being anti-social. I already know what I want in life, and strive for it (as I mentioned in paragraph 4). What everyone else does is none of my concern. I have already started to But do I really have to deal with the tyranny of parenthood?

I feel at the mercy of my parents in order to survive, seeing as how they pay for everything that I do in my life.

This website is not the first time I have tried to make my own voice be heard. The first time I ever had control of a website was in 2014, when I setup a BlargBoard forum about a NSMBW mod I was in the process of making. My brother and I used to shitpost on it a lot, and we had fun. Unfortunately, the co-owner banned me and got me to shut down the website. Losing database-based websites is common for me, due to it happening a couple of times after (revival of that forum, BlargBoard XD dev forum, Super All-Stars Gaming, 3dshacks & Mario Making Mods twice). What I still don't understand is why they couldn't ignore the troll (me) and let me have my fun. The only thing I did on my website that related to them was that I put the link to my site in my forum account's signature.I'm glad this website is static and hosted on git, as it means

After the disaster that was "Boys State", my teacher wanted us to read a book titled "Into the Wild" by John Krackaur.
