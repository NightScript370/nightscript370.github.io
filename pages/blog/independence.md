Independence is when you are no longer tied to others, being completely responsible for yourself. The legal age where a child can be independent here in the United States is 18 years old, which for most people is post-high school graduation. Afterwards, they're just one summer away from going to college, some of which offers dormings. You're no longer told which classes to go to, as you are now trusted to pick them out for yourself. Within the years post-high school, you're expected to finally find your own footing in life and get a job, raise your own income and provide for yourself. No more parents to pack sandwhiches, tuck you into bed or cover up for tax evasion!

Just like Privacy, it is not possible to have a life that is completely unreliant on anything. Otherwise, who knows where we'd be living, in both the metaphorical sense and literal sense. Our bodies were not designed to live without air flowing in our lungs, food flowing through our throats and being held by a mother for 9 months. We also need government protection because without it, everyone would just act wild towards eachother. The only good thing about that would be that crime rates would drop down to zero, since there wouldn't be a definition of crime! :P

There's also merit to having bosses control you beyond visible benefits (such as protection). Even if you were a perfect human being who never made a wrong thought, that doesn't mean that no one else is like you. Just by taking a look at the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot trust everyone to willingly cooporate without throwing a petty excuse such as "it discomforts me". This is mostly true in the United States, but we have our own problem of having the right to own a gun. Just because you're not thinking to shoot up a school filled with innocent children that might have just been brainwashed doesn't mean that no one else is doing that. The only reason that no school shootings occured in the past year is because there has been no schools to shoot in the first place!

However, this does not extend to everything. Children should not be shunned away from jobs because the law wants them to go to prison for 6 hours of their life every day. I should be allowed to pick which person I want to marry, even if it is the same sex (not implying that I would do it, but it should be allowed). If there's any health problems, I should be able to decide for myself if it's worth taking the risk instead of requiring government approval. Rights are a common thing to wish for, especially for people at a young age who feels like they're at the mercy of their parents.

### Internet

<p>Enter the Internet, the place which in 2020, we could not live without. What do you expect kids to do without it? Have social interactions?<br>
It's just a magical place where people are exposed to a lot of external media, good and bad. Blogs, Galleries, News Networks, Dating, you name it; it's on the internet (but please make sure that last one stays buried in the dark web). <span style="float: right; width: 4em; height: 4em; margin-left: 10px;"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699540999072120923/801541863152418856/bruhRoo.png"></span>The freedom of speech exercised on the internet means that cursed creations could be made without reprocautions, such as bruhRoo from YourKalamity. Outside of memes, there's two other free speech areas on the internet; journalism and communication</p>

The informational part of the internet means that we no longer need to waste hours trying to do something only to fail, as someone has already done that and got generous enough to donate the final product. Misinformation is quickly called out ([MOST OF THE TIME](https://legendary-archive.tumblr.com/post/189857810354/hey-there-princey-nerdy-as-heck-m-pennanti)), which means it's reliable enough as long as you go on good websites. Now, what defines a good website? According to school, anything except Wikipedia which doesn't make much sense seeing as how just like how anyone can sign up on Wikipedia and edit whatever, anyone can make their own website and write whatever. Well, this comes down to my point of independence, which we should be able to determine for ourselves what is reliable information and what is misinformation. Unfortunately, the world is filled with idiots and just like the former United States president, misinformation would spread. At first, sites didn't care Of course, we cannot  The enterntainment possibilities on this are also amazing; I always wanted to stream Grovert Cleveland's history, and now I can using Netflix! People have made both funny and cringy images, such as bruhRoo by YourKalamity (WHY)

However, it is also a communication platform, where this year, a lot of people migrated their physical interactivity to the digital space. This is where I found my own thoughtfulness and became independently thinking from my parents, seeing as how I was basically raised here. I was prepared to not be too trusting of people online, and the physical safety of both my family and I would not be compromised by my actions. There is no face attached to my online identity that can match with my real one. My first name is public, yet my last isn't. My birthday is public, yet not my birthplace. My mental safety, though, was not expecting the harsh negative actions of online communities.

#### Communication on the Internet Independence
##### Growing Up into a world where I managed for myself

The COPPA rules prevent young ones to go on the internet without parental supervision, yet my parents were trusting. We didn't have things such as time limits or filters growing up, and one of my favorite games was a social platform (Club Penguin). My intentions were always to stay in the kids realm, since I wasn't really interested in things like violent video games or dating. However, the one thing we need to learn about the internet is that one link can lead to another, such as YouTube video descriptions.

After booting up and playing New Super Mario Bros Wii for probably hundreds of time, I was getting tired of the default stages~sorry, I mean [*courses*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/708423907731832882/799507169291665418/unknown.png). The game engine had so much to offer, and I was hoping to see if I could do any cool tricks beyond what was shown in the "Super Guide" videos of Princess Peach's castle. I stumbled upon a video of NSMBW, but something was off about the terrain and the title said "Custom Level". I was blown away; I could make my own custom creations? This was before Super Mario Maker was a thing, and I guess I never knew what fan games were, so this was my first exposure. I was curious about this, so the rabbit hole went deeper as I found another video on how to make my own "custom levels".

The video, sadly, was not something I could follow along. It didn't specify how to mod your Wii, and creating the folders described simply wasn't going to cut it. I needed two channels, both of which I didn't own; The Homebrew Channel & Riivolution. Still, I wanted to see more of what the community had to offer so a quick Google search linked to the NSMBW Level Depot, containing thousands of custom creations. The intended place to talk about these, though, was the Forums linked on the sidebar. A new account was made and I was ready to be involved in NSMBW modding.

I was too overambitious despite having no skills, which made a new hack announcement from me seem like a joke. My goal was to imitate Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii, a hack that took 3 years to make by multiple professionals that were over at least the age of 15. Despite that, I felt like I had what it took to do so, and made a new website to talking about it. The forum was ran by myself and my brother, who was eight years old and jealous that I was allowed on these places and he wasn't. We had a lot of fun on this forum of ours, and since no one really took us seriously, we were just trash-posting away. Family drama also got involved, like that one time I wanted to ban him for something that happened in-person. However, we started to forget what the forum was really about, and since it was being advertised as its initial purpose, it was clickbait for immaturity-display.

The community disliked us, and we were constantly banned. My brother's ban was put into effect the month after he joined the official NSMBW hacking forums, while my time was gradual and I got unbanned and rebanned multiple times. Even the co-owner who helped me initially make the website turned on me, and took control of my own site to mock me. I was pushed away into a "derp"-corner and I ended up bonding with people who were also rejects. The same song-and-dance happened for years, never really ending until 2018 when I finally took a good look at who I was surrounding myself with.

##### Living on my own in the internet realm right now

Seven years later, I find myself surrounded with much better people which has really improved my acceptance level in these communities. My contributions to the DS(i) Mode Hacking Discord Server reserved me a spot in Nintendo Modding History, alongside famous modders like RocketRobz & Evie. Through my time moderating that server, I've met amazing friends who have stuck with me ever since, such as Lanya, Kodtiz3D, Kaisaan, Evie and MUCH more. Wanting to stick this group alongside my other friends, I made a personal hub called the NightScript Domain. The response to articles like these keep me motivated to write more, and to contribute more. The community is always growing, so much so that last week, I added in a Matrix bridge for the Discord server (which I find myself using more than Discord). My social life is, as a result, primarily found online.

I love to contribute to the social surroundings I find myself in, seeing as how that's what true love is really about. Love isn't about what you love benefitting you, but how you can benefit it. Yamamura was something I loved, but what I really loved was all the time I found myself coding and managing to solve bugs with Samplasion. Rewritting articles on this website proves to be a tedious task (every single article on this website got an update since initial publish date), yet I constantly want to make sure they are of their utmost quality. It's why I've developed a workoholic behavior, but it doesn't bother me. Unfortunately, most of the people in my social surroundings look at it different.

My parents are currently the most dismissive people of my creative potential, which is bad when I want my privacy. A """helicopter""" hovers over my physical actions at all times, watching my every move (such as where I am, why I'm leaving, etc). I often discouraged from doing what I do, even when it has proven to be successful. When I started tutoring children, I was told "well, do you know your stuff? Maybe you should let a proffessional do it". Once the kid ended up completing his project better than how a proffessional would have taught them, my parents would tell others about how *their* "marvelous-son" did these actions. Other times, they take credit for decisions I make, such as clothes I buy. What's worst is when I find myself being refused things I like "just because".

When I went to New York for my sister's wedding, I had breakfast by my brother-in-law's house alongside everyone else in my family. This is one of those "family bonding" times I was not able to leave, which was frustrating because I had already finished eating and there was no one to speak with there. I had Google Maps to tell me where to go, the journey was not long and it was in broad day light, so the risk of danger was low. There was no reason to keep me there beyond control, which is not something I like to be detained by. My intentions on leaving were to go to our temopary resitance house in order to study with friends and [contribute to TWiLight Menu++](/blog/summer-2020#part-8--nightscript-vs-twilight-menu). Though, they didn't know that, because I often times don't inform them of explanations.

I never tell my parents anything in terms of things that occurred, which means they get informed through other methods. When confronted with these events, my response is to act like a CIA officer, only telling them glimpses that they need to know and nothing more. They found out that I cried when [I thought my friend committed suicide](/blog/effects-of-9th-grade#anti-iphone-gone-legal), yet were never aware of who the person was or the after-math involving the iOS bug being sent out to my classmates. My refusal to do my work during the summer was something my teacher thought they needed to know, yet they never knew how I ended up [writting a rant about it](/blog/edgenuity-issues) (which got me [a good grade in the class](/blog/summer-2020#part-5--nightscript-vs-summer-school)). (Before you ask; I didn't expose myself through this article, as they don't even know I'm writting this or have my own website 😛).

Unfortunately, I am dependent on people like my parents in order to provide me basic substinance. If I ever decide to escape one day, I would be at the mercy of not being able to afford life necessities (such as food or hotel room) due to not having a job. I am unable to get a job both due to age and this pandemic closing down a lot of businesses. Homelessness is not a bright option due to being unaware of what goes on during the streets at night time. This type of control that parents have over children is common (in fact, one of my bosses told me I'm *too* independent and that they would not let their hypothetical teenager do what I've done, despite it being proven to be successfull). However, it's not like breaking away hasn't been tried before.

Christopher McCandless was only a college graduate when he abandoned his old life and attempted to rebuild it. Learning of his father's relationship issues was a devistating blow, when a few years prior, he had gifted him a telescope for his birthday. After giving his parents a cold shoulder for a while, he decided to hide behind a mask to make them think that they've won. After that, he donated all his money to a charity and drove his car far away from home, dropping everyone he knew and loved in one fell-swoop. In his new life (under a new alias), Alex has jumped from household 

I am at their mercy for things such as getting a drivers license, fixing up my Canada -> US process and so much more. Homelessness is not a bright option to take, due to being unaware of what goes on during the streets. If I wanted to fend for myself, I'd have to rent out a hotel

Unfortunately, society hasn't accepted that 17 year olds

Most of the people in my social surroundings have their friends in person, which makes me feel This is in stark contrast to other classmates of mine in my social surroundings, as clearly observed when I independently decide to go to study on my own. While other 17 year olds waste their money going out with their thousandth girl-friend while watching brain-rottening video on TikTok, I find myself anti-social, preffering work habits that might make others look at me like I'm a workaholic. For my privacy article, I have worked for 4 hours straight and 9 hours in total on publish-day (December 31st, 2020), talking with antoine and discovering new things to add to my article. It wasn't until I got up after the straight work session where I discovered my hunger and my lack of food (which wasn't helpful when I was tutoring). I have also pushed sleep last week (January 7th, 2021) to work on an upcoming article regarding politics, staying up working until 11:30 PM/23:30 and falling asleep after 12:18 AM (but not without mocking Evie and StackZ, the two official non-sleepers of Universal-Team). I don't like to take time off, because I like to practice who I am.

Unfortunately, my parents aren't really too encouraging of who I am, often times trying to control me rather than let my life be. I have to tell them everywhere I go, otherwise I am not allowed to exit the house. I often get discouraged from doing what I do, even when it has proven to be successful. When I started tutoring children, I was told "well, do you know your stuff? Maybe you should let a proffessional do it". Once the kid ended up completing his project better than how a proffessional would have taught them, they end up bragging about it. Other times, they take credit for decisions I make, such as clothes I buy. This is why I try to stay relatively hidden from family.

The problem with this is that as of the initial publish date of this article, I am still under my parent' house and as such, I must respect their wishes. However, I try my best to have as much control of my life as possible, such as not tell them a 17 year old is considered underage and needs to be dependent on a guardian. The guardian typically doesn't understand what the kid wants, and dismisses their creative potential. When I went to New York for my sister's wedding, I was not allowed to walk home to go study and was forced to stay at my brother-in-law's house with everyone else. I felt frustrated because I needed to go home in order to study and [contribute to TWiLight Menu++](/blog/summer-2020#part-8--nightscript-vs-twilight-menu). This seems to be common, as one of my bosses told me how they would treat their hypothetical 17 year old son.

Although I've gathered quite an audience of live friends, this had been relatively hidden from my family. In fact, they are only aware of glimpses of personal events is because someone else disclosed few details to them. They found out that I cried when [I thought my friend committed suicide](/blog/effects-of-9th-grade#anti-iphone-gone-legal), yet were never aware of who the person was or the after-math involving the iOS bug being sent out to my classmates. My refusal to do my work during the summer was something my teacher thought they needed to know, yet they never knew how I ended up [writting a rant about it](/blog/edgenuity-issues) (which got me [a good grade in the class](/blog/summer-2020#part-5--nightscript-vs-summer-school)). When they demand explanations for what they do hear, I act like CIA officers who only tell them what they need to know and nothing more. (Before you ask; I didn't expose myself through this article, as they don't even know I'm writting this or have my own website 😛).

The reason why I am like this is because I value things differently, hence why we always find ourselves in a conflict of interest due to a lack of mutual understanding. I value my work and studies, to the point of obsession and workaholic-ism. For my privacy article, I have worked for 4 hours straight and 9 hours in total on publish-day (December 31st, 2020), talking with antoine and discovering new things to add to my article. It wasn't until I got up after the straight work session where I discovered my hunger and my lack of food (which wasn't helpful when I was tutoring). I have also pushed sleep last week (January 7th, 2021) to work on an upcoming article regarding politics, staying up working until 11:30 PM/23:30 and falling asleep after 12:18 AM (but not without mocking Evie and StackZ, the two official non-sleepers of Universal-Team). I don't like to take time off, because I like to practice who I am.

However, I do not consider myself like the other 17 year olds my age. While they're out TikTok'ing and hanging out with their thousandth girl friend, I find myself being anti-social. I already know what I want in life, and strive for it (as I mentioned in paragraph 4). What everyone else does is none of my concern. I have already started to But do I really have to deal with the tyranny of parenthood?

I feel at the mercy of my parents in order to survive, seeing as how they pay for everything that I do in my life.

This website is not the first time I have tried to make my own voice be heard. The first time I ever had control of a website was in 2014, when I setup a BlargBoard forum about a NSMBW mod I was in the process of making. My brother and I used to shitpost on it a lot, and we had fun. Unfortunately, the co-owner banned me and got me to shut down the website. Losing database-based websites is common for me, due to it happening a couple of times after (revival of that forum, BlargBoard XD dev forum, Super All-Stars Gaming, 3dshacks & Mario Making Mods twice). What I still don't understand is why they couldn't ignore the troll (me) and let me have my fun. The only thing I did on my website that related to them was that I put the link to my site in my forum account's signature.I'm glad this website is static and hosted on git, as it means
