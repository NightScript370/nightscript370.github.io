On January 20th 2020, Joe Biden has entered the White House and currently sits in the Oval Office. This former vice president promises to enhance the environment, bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic amongst other celebratory things. The democrats in our country and foreigners are welcoming him, yet that hasn't extended to the republican president who governed before him.<br>
Donald J Trump, the 45th president of the United States of America, is unable to accept the results that the American public has rejected him. Since admitting defeat is viewed as cowardly, he goes back to his old routine of claiming it was rigged against him. This pattern was called out back in a presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, but 4 years has passed since then. Surely, then, after being president, he would have learned to accept that some things aren't in his hand and that not everything is about him. Yet, as time advanced, my viewpoints on him has remained relatively the same.

Rather than dry-humping stuffed animals [like others in his country](http://www.brevardtimes.com/2019/10/florida-man-arrested-for-having-sex-with-olaf-toy-at-target/), he invested in business and adopted an economic viewpoint, helping millions of Americans find jobs during the first three years of his single-term presidency. Running as a Republican and fighting against the media's biased views amongst many more were things I would have never even thought a president can do. The video from Vox about how Trump is making what used to be unthinkable to be considered boring is quite descriptive of the presidents plans:

As described in the video, though, this has ushered in a far-right era. During the past 4 years, hate speech rates have skyrocketted (including a [literal Hitler speech](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/jqdddl/maga_crowd_cheers_for_a_guy_giving_a_literal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)) and the contrast between the left-wingers and right-wingers is much bigger than it was before. There are now Liberals, Republicans and Trump-Republicans, leaving our country very devided. One of the areas of devision is the COVID-19 pandemic.

### COVID-19

Since the very beginning, we've seen a clear devision on how republicans and democrats approach the pandemic. Calling themselves 'pro-life', general republicans should be concerned about a deadly disease. However, the response to the lockdown has been protesting because of reasons that I'll dispute below. The Trump-Republicans, though, have been calling this a democatic hoax that is only relevant for bashing Trump. According to them, the reason that the economy is shut down, COVID is always brought up on CNN, COVID cases are so high is all a tactic that the democrats use to say "Trump is bad, get Biden in. He'll stop it". By "stop the pandemic", Biden would make the mainstream media stop talking about it because there was no problem in the first place. The stats show otherwise, as over 100k fellow americans got the virus the week **after** Election Day (November 3rd). On November 26th 2020, over 2k americans have died from it. Either way, records are broken, civilians are hospitalized and people are dying. It's clear that it's not going away any soon, but how did we get it like this?

Becuase of **Trumps** failed management. We could have been like New Zeland and the effect this virus had on us could have been like Ebola, but the department for pandemics was shut down and the virus was constantly being downplayed. He lied to the entire american people, yet kept the truth to Woodward. Want proof? Look at his quotes:

> So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!<br>
> &mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237027356314869761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2020</a>

That's why they constantly talk about it on CNN, Rather than look at what's the reason the virus is spreading **right now**, they'd rather look at how it **started**. This is why China is too blame, but we also need to take our own responsibility, right?

Nope, it is what it is, it seems. It's just simply inevitable that it would spread to everyone and there's no possible way to ever stop this from becoming a leading cause of death in our country, right? But hey, if people stopped caring for it, it would magically disapear, right? Wrong again. Just because people aren't getting tested doesn't mean they wouldn't have the virus. If they didn't test, they wouldn't know and just act carelessly, rather than knowing and taking necessary procautions. But hey, it's only being talked about because Trump's in office. If he was voted out, no one would ever talk about it, right? That's what he's saying when he says 

Stats show otherwise though; Just recently, over 100k fellow americans now have the virus in their immune system, the week **after** the Election day. Records are broken, civilians are hospitalized and people are dying. Yet he still thinks this virus is about him? I'm sorry, but viruses don't come out to target one specific person.

As for why cases are so high, instead of saying "it is what it is", look at the other countries and learn from them. New Zeland currently has 0 COVID-19 cases because of a mask mandate instituted there, yet republicans are so caught up in their rights that they would risk passing on a deadly disease to others for their comfort. Their excuses are invalidated, but let's take a look at them:

- "My body, My Choice"
   - Wouldn't the same apply to abortion, something you are against Mr Trump? Do they hold a stance when it's convenient for them, yet don't want to apply it to all?
   - Why are you wearing clothes? Your body, your choice, right? Before you come up with excuses like "masks are uncomfortable and clothes are comfortable", just as there are uncomfortable clothing, there are comfortable masks. The stereotype is therefore invalid. Just like we expect society to wear clothes ([well, most of us anyway](https://i.imgur.com/QA6VMtl.png)), why not expect people to wear masks.
- "85% of people who wear masks get COVID"
   - We cannot verify how they acted during the pandemic
   - Masks don't protect the user. It protects others from getting COVID by the user. Masks are a selfless thing, and anyone who refuses to wear one is selfish from those who don't want to catch it.
- "99% of people who catch COVID survives afterwards"
   - That doesn't mean that we want to deal with bad lungs and stuff like that.
- "It's just a flu"
   - 5x deadlier than the flu, said by the president (of course, in private; he loves to play down the virus to not create panic) in Febuary & just last month by CDC
- "We still have an economy"
   - Yeah, that would go into a song-and-dance of a rise and fall if we don't get this over with rather than trying to life with it.

For that matter, I might as well explain Trump's thought process; The reason Trump doesn't reply to these bashes is because he thinks he's doing a great job. In his mind, the shutdown of China borders would have prevented twice the deaths we currently have and anything more would be harmful to the economy in the short term. I'm not denying that the shutdown of Chinese directly coming to America slowed down the cases, but **only** blocking out China when people that have the virus have already visited other areas of the world is pointless.

But that's his focus; short term solutions. He wants to impress people that "I stopped an entire foreign pandemic, vote for me again". Rushing out vaccines to be announced on November 3rd, claiming the pandemic has reached its curve when we're in the 3rd phase of the 1st wave amongst much more issues is just making this political. Yet, that's what he claims the dems do. 

He put himself in this pandemic situation. If he kept the office that would help prevent pandemics instead of destroying it in 2017, Trump would have been prepared and numbers closer to New Zealand would have seemed as a realistic possibility. But rather than wondering what should have been done, we could live in the present and look forward to fixing. Joe Biden will be the president and he has a great COVID plan. All Trump has to do is give over the presidency keys and have him control the boat, right?

### McEnany's constant suckup

However, Ky

### Voter Fraud alligations

That would be a great plan, if not for the simple fact that Trump is not conceding anytime soon. Just like how COVID was rigged against him by the Chinese Comunist Party, the integrity of our democracy was also rigged against him. Even in 2016, when Trump was **winning**, the Since very early on, Trump has tried to discredit election results, ***even when they supported him***

### My political stance (or rather the lack thereof)

As I was taking down notes from Brian Tyler Cohen and pbanj from Nintendo Homebrew, I thought I was a leftus and that all republicans were bad. However, after speaking with a few republicans myself, I can say that I am...lost. I do not like abortion, yet I After reading these notes, I was 

Deep down, he knows he's wrong. He lied about COVID-19 to the entire public, yet told the truth to a news reporter. He lost in court cases regarding the claim that republicans
