A presidential election has just ended, and Joe Biden was pronounced the 46th president of the USA. Starting his first term in 2021, he promises to enhance the environment and to bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a moment of celebration for the rest of the world, but the man currently behind the oval office doesn't think as the rest of us.<br>
Claiming that there was voter fraud, the current president in office is unable to accept the results that he finally lost. He claimed that the results are rigged against him, just like any time he loses anything. This pattern was called out back in a presidential debate with Hillary Clinton, but 4 years has passed since then. Surely, then, after being president, he would have learned to accept that some things aren't in his hand and that not everything is about him. Yet, as time went on, we still saw the same manchild we saw 4 years ago. Times advanced, yet his maturity level hasn't. This man, is Donald J Trump, the 45th president of the United States of America.

### The CoronaVirus Pandemic

This is the first time I've actually explicitly about the outbreak. Normally, I would write about its results and what I did, but how did we get to said results? President Trump's bad administration.

COVID-19 is apparently a tactic by the chinese government that the democrats use for the purposes of bashing Trump. As a "proof", he claims that the media would stop talking about the pandemic if he was voted out. Stats show otherwise though; Just recently, over 100k fellow americans now have the virus in their immune system, the week **after** the Election day. Records are broken, civilians are hospitalized and people are dying. Yet he still thinks this virus is about him? I'm sorry, but viruses don't come out to target one specific person.

As for why cases are so high, instead of saying "it is what it is", look at the other countries and learn from them. New Zeland currently has 0 COVID-19 cases because of a mask mandate instituted there, yet republicans are so caught up in their rights that they would risk passing on a deadly disease to others for their comfort. Their excuses are invalidated, but let's take a look at them:

- "My body, My Choice"
   - Wouldn't the same apply to abortion, something you are against Mr Trump? Do they hold a stance when it's convenient for them, yet don't want to apply it to all?
   - Why are you wearing clothes? Your body, your choice, right? Before you come up with excuses like "masks are uncomfortable and clothes are comfortable", just as there are uncomfortable clothing, there are comfortable masks. The stereotype is therefore invalid. Just like we expect society to wear clothes ([well, most of us anyway](https://i.imgur.com/QA6VMtl.png)), why not expect people to wear masks.
- "85% of people who wear masks get COVID"
   - We cannot verify how they acted during the pandemic
   - Masks don't protect the user. It protects others from getting COVID by the user. Masks are a selfless thing, and anyone who refuses to wear one is selfish from those who don't want to catch it.
- "99% of people who catch COVID survives afterwards"
   - That doesn't mean that we want to deal with bad lungs and stuff like that.
- "It's just a flu"
   - 5x deadlier than the flu, said by the president (of course, in private; he loves to play down the virus to not create panic) in Febuary & just last month by CDC

For that matter, I might as well explain Trump's thought process; The reason Trump doesn't reply to these bashes is because he thinks he's doing a great job. In his mind, the shutdown of China borders would have prevented twice the deaths we currently have and anything more would be harmful to the economy in the short term. I'm not denying that the shutdown of Chinese directly coming to America slowed down the cases, but **only** blocking out China when people that have the virus have already visited other areas of the world is pointless. can go to other country have been visiting the entire world so they should have shut down even more places. The issue about short term is because that's his focus; he wanted to make sure he could get a re-election, implanting doubt in his head that he would have lost.

### Voter Fraud alligations

Deep down, he knows he's wrong. He lied about COVID-19 to the entire public, yet told the truth to a news reporter. He lost in court cases regarding the claim that republicans
