For some reason, I have been having issues with ownership. What's the coorolation between ownership and power? What do you truely own? How much can you change a product until it is deemed yours?

Before I get into the bad experiences, I might as well mention that I do have some great experiences.

- Yamamura was developed by Samplasion and myself, and we expressed that clearly. We were an unstoppable coding team, and I could not have asked for a better partner. I wish he was the partner I had for all the other stories, but I appreciate the help he gave me for Yamaumra.
- DeadSkullzJr and I disagree heavily on what to archive and what to not, what's considered good and what's considered not, etc. Outside of that, we actually work great together. We plan to do a new website for DS archives and I already did the engine. Best of all; I'm in the footer credits (something to keep a note of) even though he'll provide all the content.

Also keep in mind that I will not reveal any names since this isn't trying to be a call out post. This is rather my personal experiences with ownership issues and I'm just listing my frustrations. I don't mean any hate to any of the people I rag on here (except power abusers in Discord bots) and most of these are from a long time ago. If you know who they are; good for you. Please don't bring this up to them saying "NightScript is calling you out" since this isn't the intention.

### Mario Making Mods - Co-Owner issues

So, in December of 2016, I expressed my desire to make a forum dedicated to Super Mario Maker modding due to the evergrowing community. RHCafe had a Super Mario Maker Hacking subforum which was inactive, but it still existed and we really didn't need an entire place dedicated to Mario Maker modding, so we dropped the conversation. However, in April of 2017, RHCafe recieved a memory leak, leading to its shut down. Since it's only home got shutdown, it needed a new one. I brought up the idea again to the same person, hoping that my point would be clearer, but he forwarded it to his friend to do instead of do it himself. Said person made what were at the time popular mods, so I knew that he was a reliable Super Mario Maker modder and could help me get the word out there. While he bought a URL, I setup the forums. However, two weeks in, things started to get a little bit frustrating between his team and I. We ended up splitting and since he had the URL, he could do whatever he wants. He set up his own forum under the old URL, but no one was aware we moved. To be fair, he didn't have to; why would he advertise a competitor? But then again, it was my content under his URL; did that make it his content?

The timeline moves on to late October 2017. I was now found with a new host with an owner who I will not describe a single bit due to potential legal issues I might have. The basic jist is that we did not communicate properly and I ended up getting locked out of the VPS that hosted Mario Making Mods. My data had to be stolen through an account I made for a friend, but legally, I had been locked out of my own content. After that, I had to self-host the forums under my money. The problem was I picked an awful VPS host which means I was not getting my moneys worth. It lasted until mid 2018, where I couldn't refill my prepaid credit card. At that point, I came into contact with the person who hosted rverse since I couldn't afford to go with someone who asked money from me. This was the second time I took chances with letting my content be hosted with someone else and it took a complete unexpected 180 on me. Unlike the person I had dealt with before, this new person was nice and was glad to help out another fellow modding community. However, they did shady things which I do not feel comfortable enough talking about here. The case in point is that we got locked out multiple times, and Oman Computar had to pay from their own pocket in order to keep the VPS going. At that point, wouldn't it be considered Oman's VPS?

So, why am I bringing this up? This all happened in 2017-2018, yet it was the start for ownership issues for me. For one, the contents of the old URL were mine yet it was his URL. The contents of the VPS was mine yet it was paid by outsiders. Was I truely the owner of Mario Making Mods? Or was it me and some other people?

### DSi Modding Guide - what wasn't mine isn't mine

Well, let's jump to an entirely different time point, to 2019-2020. At this point, I've completely lost interest in Mario Maker modding and have moved onto another aspect of nostalgia: the Nintendo DS. Since I've learned what flashcarts were, I was obsessed with them going as far as attempting to buy them...twice. While I was never able to get any myself, I was still glad I could experience their magical homebrew via nds-bootstrap. A huge congrats to RocketRobz, ahezard, shutterbug2000 and everyone else involved for nds-bootstrap and it was a good alternative for non-flashcart owners such as myself. Unfortunately, FileTrip would announce its closure for April 2019 and with it, a bunch of flashcart kernels. I felt it was important to have all those kernels backed up as it allow new flashcart owners to experienced all the homebrew I fell in love with. There was already an index page on the GBAtemp wiki listing all the FileTrip links, but I couldn't edit it as I needed a GBAtemp wiki account. In order to get a GBAtemp wiki account, you'd have to ask a wiki administrator. I didn't want to take the risk of the list being down forever because a GBAtemp admin didn't respond to me. What I did instead was take the Wiki code, convert it to Markdown and place the new list (with the new links pointing to a GitHub repository I made) on a fork I made for a universal DSi Guide website.

The website was a hot mess and extremely confusing for anyone that wasn't 2019-me. Plus, no one wanted to help support it. I reached out to DeadSkullzJr who was trying to work on his own list, so I didn't want to bother him. Besides, at the time, I wasn't as good of friends with him as I am right now; I hardly knew him. The people on DS(i) Mode Hacking would claim my website is "out of date" the day after making a Pull Request to the main DSi Guide just with a version change. It was quite clear that changes had to be made on my part. Since I couldn't do things on my own, I thought I might be able to contribute to already existing resources. I wanted to keep the flashcart list on a separate website since I wanted to make it into a fully fledged guide. The 3DS stuff was miniscule and already self-explanatory so those could be removed. However, there were changes I made to the DSi Guide and since it's a fork of the true DSi Guide, I figured moving all my changes there would be better for the community.

At the time, the site owner was literally no where to be found so it was up to RocketRobz and any other contributor to update it, and the means of updating it were...awful. Why is there two separate pages for installing unlaunch with only one section difference? I fixed that and decided to do much more. It went to the point where I technically rewrote the whole website, accommodating the last year of non changes. Updated it to standards, removed a few useless parts, made it into my own style, etc.. Problem? It still wasn't my website. I couldn't put my name in the footer, the icon was still the icon that was made in two seconds and the repo was under someone who abandoned the guide.

Then, out of literally nowhere, the site owner returned. She was nice, offering me half money of ads, giving me write access to the repo & we setup a cfw.guide community (in terms of a GitHub organization and Discord Server for communication). However, she wanted the guides to be consistent with the other cfw.guide websites which meant conflicting design philosophies between what I did and hers.

To be fair, she had all the rights to do it; it was her website. It was my fault for continuing to modify another persons website, so of course she would want to take it back. The whole thing should have stopped at fixes and not go past that. Instead, I basically rewrote her website and added my name to the footer credits. This situation is even more complex than what happened with Mario Making Mods, since it was never mine to start with, but I simply "made it mine". So, as I was saying before, she rewrote it to make it streamlined, which directly conflicted with my open ended aproach. This ended up to what was basically a complete rewrite of the website, so did I really do anything long term? I really don't want to sound like a brat, but it is something to think about when discussing ownership.

### Discord Bots - The eventual end to everything & the answer to all

Before we begin, please note that I will not be looking into every bot. Some of them (like Kurisu) have had hours of work spent into it and they couldn't copy paste because no other modding bot existed like Kurisu at the time of its development. I will, however, be looking at parts of Yamamura (my own Discord Bot) and over 122K bots hosted on BotGhost. Are those really your bots?

Most discord bots are just front end to libraries. Discord.JS Music Bots? You connect to Youtube and then use Discord.JS's music player. You haven't done anything other than stitch things. BotGhost bots? It's literally pay them, select things from a menu and then your bot is there. Again, you haven't done anything. People who blindly follow video guides are even worse, since you are literally copy pasting from others. So what makes a Discord Bot yours in those instances?

The fact that you control it. Yep, that's how all these above cases work. You get to control who uses it and who can't. Most users would call that a blacklist, but I call it theft. Who are you to decide who uses other peoples services? You haven't coded anything other than a frontend (probably stolen) for the service.

To be fair, I'm guilty of this too. I never blacklisted anyone in Yamamura (though I was very close to doing so), but there are times where I would take someone else's code. The difference? I try to make it unique by introducing my own spins to it.

*   Image commands layered and properly resized.
*   The poll command got many improvements to functionality.
*   The initial points code was made by Hindsight. Samplasion and I introduced balancing of levels, switched to a new DB engine and much more.
*   The video selection queue was complex and used a design language.
*   In fact, most things have my unique design language, of having anything bonus in the embed with anything mandatory in the main message.

### Bonus: This website - Unusual Conflict

I've decided to add in a little segment here about this very website. It doesn't fit in the above sections and not with my plot progression of "power is everything", but I still wanted to present the personal conflict I have.

First off, I'm not talking about content. Content will always be mine and I wouldn't steal it. No point in doing so, since this is supposed to be NightScript's domain, not NightScript & co. I would get help writing a few things, but ideas are entirely mine. So what do I mean?

Well, I mean the actual layout of the website itself. First off, the sidebar code originated from a template I found online and I heavily modified it. Only bits and pieces of the original is there. Are the changes made enough to be called "my own sidebar code"?

The actual layout of the website is designed around the blue midnight mountain asthetic found in the Midnight UI custom theme for Discord. I didn't steal any of their code, but just the color asthetic used. Plus, this was all coded ontop of the Bootstrap CSS Framework. As it is right now, the UI is a weird mismap between a minified sidebar design and an asthetic from Midnight UI. The unique features to differentiate myself in terms of UI is the background & the sidebar design.

*   The background used in Midnight UI is a macOS background while I pulled up a background from Google Images
*   The sidebar design does not match up with either designs. The template code used extremely padded sidebar elements with a border (aka not sleek and modern). Midnight UI has all the links have a grey background meaning not directly embedded into the page. My design has the links directly on top of the sidebar with slim padding and no borders.

To take context into perspective though, the sidebar design is so different that no one would realize what it what once was. BetterDiscord isn't commonly used and most people who use it don't use Midnight UI. Plus, from a first glance, the untrained eye wouldn't be able to tell that these two have any similarities because the sidebar and background differences. That's why I'm not worried for this website. It's weird for me to bring this up though, because I've never had any interactions with either of these developers. If they do mind though, I'll change it.

### Main takeaway

In life, you'll always have to use something provided by someone else. Heck, to even access this page, you have to use external contributions (people who made CSS standards, people who built your device, people who built the OS, people who build the web browser, etc...). They made these things for you though. However, know what's yours, what isn't, and the definition of ownership.

For Mario Making Mods, both websites are now dead and so is the original discord server. For an archive, I plan to make it a static website on GitHub pages so there wouldn't be any issues with hosting. As for URL, I think the new URL will be gone after May 28th, 2020. If that is the case, I'll use the traditional github.io URL, and again; discord is a coorporation and not individual users. Besides, in regards to ownership issues, neither of us own Mario Making Mods anymore. On August 2019, I have transfered ownership to bunten due to wanting to focus more on school and homework, and I wasn't involved with where the server was heading. The original account of the co-owner got deleted by discord team (unfairly, might I add) and I wonder if the Mario Making Mods discord server would have been deleted as well if he was still owner. Though, GRAnimated found his new discord account, we met up and laughed at our old management tactics. I had more listed on this page but honestly, that'd just drama fuel and not really part of the "guide to ownership" so I dropped it. I still feel it was kind of worth keeping it _somewhere_, since this is a personal blog. If you do find it, do note that reading it would go against the other person's wishes.

Yamamura is right now in a state of limbo. Officially, I don't give support and I no longer host the bot, but someone could obviously rehost it. The parts that are mine? Yeah, I definitely want credit for all the work I've sinked it, but what really is mine and not? However, in a hypothetical situation where Yamamura would have continued on, that would no longer be an issue. Basically, I planned to code a rewrite where the backend (bot code) and the front end (Discord) were separate, so the bot would be able to be used on other platforms. It would also be in ES6 using modular import/export and not commonJS require. Both of those things would involve basically making the bot entirely from scratch with only a few things being able to have a direct port and those things would be extremely miniscule. I don't think that rewrite would ever happen though, since Yamamura won't officially come back any time soon.

People who just select elements from a User Interface and host the bot on BotGhost are sorry to hear that the bot will never be truely theirs. Once BotGhost shuts down, that means that all the 122K bots hosted there will also be dead. However, this does get you into the possible realm of bot development. Heck, copy pasting template code is better than a User Interface, because you will be able to see what each line of code does, modify it to suit your purposes and do your own thing. If any of you out there use BotGhost and want to start going into proper bot development, the easiest language to use is Node.JS with discord.js as the API communicator. There is a really easy guide on how to use discord.js by Hindsight and York, called [anidiots.guide](https://anidiots.guide). Don't worry; you're not an idiot for not knowing how to code. Everyone just needs to start somewhere. Hopefully you can get to the point of making fully custom bots and get your bot extremely popular, now that your bot is not a walking advertisement for "cheap" & "laziness".

This website (and any type of website in general) is composed of both engine and content. I built the engine on top of the Bootstrap CSS framework and the sidebar code is barely recognizable to the original. For custom made things, however, I gave proper credit when applicable. Evie11 helped me with Apple and Mobile support specifically for the intents of this webiste, so they deserve all the credit they got in the website information page. Content is always my own, so I feel safe saying that I created and maintained ~97% of the website. Only things stopping me is the assistance from Evie and building the website on top of bootstrap v4, but at that point, it's fine to give credit. I already did most of the work so just credit the helpers and move on. It's useless to make a big deal over it.

I sadly can't say anything about how dsi.cfw.guide would go. The spot the guide is currently going is where the original has existed for so long, on a better domain and is so prevalent that no one would use my version. Attempting to contribute to the main guide is meaningless since our design philosophies are different.

To be honest, I'm glad that these ownership issues have occured. With all this experience, I know how I will go about doing anything going forwards. My next project where I will colaborate with someone else is DeadSkullzJr's archive for Nintendo DS. I have already created the engine used and since DeadSkullzJr doesn't know how to do one himself (no offense), I'm already credited for that. Even if he could switch, he wouldn't. Unlike the other people I've had issues with, he knows how to credit fairly (that's one of the requirements for a preservation place). Working with him is extremely smooth, and it opened me up for more colaborations. If you ever need any help in any of your projects, let me know. Just, make sure you keep a diff so I know what's mine and what's yours.
